    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n <br /><br />When I unsuspectedly rented A Thousand Acres, thought I in for entertaining King Lear story Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, what could go wrong?<br /><br />Very quickly,, realized story was about A Thousand Other Things besides just Acres. started crying couldn't stop until long after movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura Jocelyn, for bringing a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved portraying characters with depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized Angry sister; Runaway sister sister in Denial. recognized Abusive Husband why he there Father, Father... all superbly played. also recognized myself this movie was an eye-opener, relief, chance to face my OWN truth finally doing something about it. hope A Thousand Acres had same effect on some others there.<br /><br />Since didn't understand why cover said film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- watched it a second time. Then able to see if one hadn't lived similar story, one would miss overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear deep bond between sisters runs through it. reason why people in often overlook truth about neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I don't give a rat's ass (pardon French) about to what extend King Lear story is followed. know can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n This latest entry in long series of films with French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French answer to James Bond). series launched in early 1950's spawned eight films (none ever released in U.S.). 'O.S.S.117:Cairo,Nest Of Spies' is a breezy little comedy should not...repeat NOT, be taken too seriously. protagonist finds himself in middle of spy chase in Egypt (with Morroco doing stand in for Egypt) to find out about long lost friend. follows standard James Bond/Inspector Cloussou antics. our man is overt xenophobe,sexist,homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as, don't take it too seriously). bit of rough language & cartoon violence,'s okay for older kids (ages 12 & up). As previously stated in subject line, just sit back,pass popcorn & enjoy.",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n This movie was frustrating. Everything seemed energetic I was prepared to have good time. thought I'd be to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, weird looping? like watching \"America's Funniest Home Videos\". damn parents. hated them much. stereo-typical Latino family? need to speak with the person responsible for. need to have a talk. little girl always hanging on someone? hated her had to mention it. Now final scene transcends, must. It's gloriously bad and full of badness it is a movie of its own. crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n I was truly wonderfully surprised at \"O' Brother, Where Art Thou?\" video store was out of all movies I was planning on renting, then came across this. came home watched became engrossed found myself laughing out loud. Coen's made magnificiant film again. the first time watch this movie, you get to know the characters. second time, now you know them, laugh hard it could hurt you. I strongly reccomend ANYONE seeing this because if you not, missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n This movie spends most time preaching script makes movie, but apparently no script when they shot this waste of time! trailer makes out to be comedy, but film can't decide if wants to be comedy, drama, romance or action film. Press releases indicated Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved script (what they thinking?). If like William Shatner (I do) see \"Free Enterprise\" instead.",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n After long time Marathi cinema has come with good movie.This movie is one of best Marathi movies ever made shows how old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye. tries everything possible in hands to save child's eye. Doctor and relative of his tries to help him in attempt.<br /><br />The acting by grandfather, boy and doctor are superb. They shown true picture of typical Marathi life. Every bit of action has meaning in it. recommend to watch this movie, initially thought this one of documentary type but was above my expectations.<br /><br />This film going to touch your hearts.I expect more Marathi movies to with performances like this.",
    "Analyze sentiment of this movie review respond with ONLY 'positive' or 'negative' (one word answer):\n\n This is a really sad, touching movie! deals with subject of child abuse. sad, but mostly true story, happens everyday. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play two children or Lorraine Bracco, single mother tries to make a home for them. living with her parents, a man, likes to be called \"The King\" comes into their life. He hits youngest boy, Bobby, two brothers vow not to tell mother finally she finds out, after Bobby is hurt badly. end ruined it for me, totally unbelievable. But except for, I love the movie."
